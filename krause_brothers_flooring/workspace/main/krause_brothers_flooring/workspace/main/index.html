						<p>
							"We needed our entire first floor wood flooring
							replaced. Knowing that this was going to be a large
							expense and a fairly permanent decision, we didn't
							want to make the mistake of having our floors redone
							by just anyone. We wanted someone who was honest
							from the very first meeting, who showed
							professionalism while in our home, and who worked
							diligently to get the job done well. Phil and Tim
							Krause far exceeded my expectations in every way.
							They are an incredible team with genuine hearts, and
							their customer service was fantastic! I would highly
							recommend the Krause Brothers to anyone I knew who
							needed hardwood floors." - <strong>Erin from
								Columbus</strong>

							"I was incredibly impressed with Krause Brothers
							Flooring! They did an excellent job giving it a
							professional look with a personal touch as they
							carefully placed boards keeping in mind not just the
							floor but the room itself. It is evident the
							brothers enjoy taking pride in their work with their
							attention to detail, knowledge of wood and wood
							care, and working with excellence until completion.
							I have already recommended their services to
							others." - <strong>Lori from Columbus</strong>

							"They were very professional, and did fantastic
							work! They were easy to work with on getting an
							estimate, and scheduling the work. They also were
							great about explaining each step of the process, as
							well as what I needed to know about after care. I
							had severely abused floors, and they did a great job
							with them, and when there was a spot that was still
							going to show imperfections due to the damage, they
							pointed them out to me before work even started.
							Will definitely recommend them to people, and would
							definitely use them again." - <strong>Beth from
								Bexley</strong>
